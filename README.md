# Introduction to Discrete Structures 

This respository contains code and resources for a dual-enrolled
[Introduction to Discrete Structures](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC208)
class offered at the [Arlington Career Center](https://careercenter.apsva.us)
through [Northern Virginia Community College](https://www.nvcc.edu/).

Since the goal is to make all our courses use only
[free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) and
[Open Educational Resources](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-educational-resources)
for all course materials, we will be using
[Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction, 3rd edition](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html)
as our primary resource.
