# Chapter 2.2: Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences 


## Arithmetic Sequence 

An **arithmetic sequence** is a sequence in which terms differ by a constant.
If the initial term ($a_0$) of the sequence is $a$, and the *common difference*
is $d$, then we have:

* Recursive definition: $a_n = a_{n-1} + d$ with $a_0 = a$.
* Closed formula: $a_n = a + dn$.


## Geometric Sequence 

A **geometric sequence** is a sequence in which the ratio between successive
terms is constant.  Suppose the initial term ($a_0$) of the sequence is $a$ and 
the *common ratio* is $r$. Then we have:

* Recursive definition: $a_n = ra_{n-1} + d$ with $a_0 = a$.
* Closed formula: $a_n = a \cdot r^n$.
