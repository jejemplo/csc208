# Chapter 0: Introduction and Preliminaries

## Jeff's Definition of Mathematics

**Mathematics**

1. The systematic study of how much / many or which one(s).

2. A game, played my mathematians.

This chapter introduces concepts and vocabulary for the study of
[logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic), which may be new to you.

## Is $0$ a Natural Number? 

There is no consensus among mathematicians as to whether $0$ is included
in the **natural numbers** (see [Is 0 a Natural Number: A Beginner's
Guide](https://www.storyofmathematics.com/is-0-a-natural-number/)).

Since discrete math is much about functions defined on the set of natural
numbers, this question is not trivial for us.  We will sometimes want to
include it, and sometimes not, so let's agree on the following notation:
$$
\N = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...\}
$$
and *does not* contain $0$, while
$$
\N_0 = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...\}
$$
does.
